# Backend for Altered Memory game

## Description
Concentration game for Mod3 project at Flatiron School. The original idea was adding a little twist to the game, the cards would move after a certain time or after every unsuccessful attempt, so the player has to not only remember the cards position, but also follow the movements. 

During Mod3 [@richie1982](https://github.com/richie1982) and I did not have enough time to implement this feature, but after graduation I started to rewrite the whole project using React and Redux. So this repo is pretty much discontinued. ðŸ˜”
