# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# p1 = Leaderboard.create(name: "Ivan", score: 1540, time: 29)
# p2 = Leaderboard.create(name: "Richie", score: 1300, time: 31)
